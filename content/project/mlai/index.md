COVID-19 fostered the generation and acquisition of data at high spatial and temporal resolution on disease surveillance and human behavior. ML and AI techniques will help us use these data to understand epidemic spread and respond to public health needs. In collaboration with [Universit√† di Bologna](https://disi.unibo.it/en).
