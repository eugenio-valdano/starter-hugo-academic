In the decades that followed the start of the epidemic, the progress in the treatment and prevention of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been substantial. Still, the epidemic is not over. Too many new infections still occur, in specific populations that are at consistently higher risk of acquiring HIV. They are what UNAIDS call _key populations_ (e.g., sex workers, men-having-sex-with-men). Also, in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the epidemic is generalized in the population, with new cases being particularly high among young women.

Some of the questions I have been asking myself are
* do mobility patterns drive the risk of HIV acquisition when the epidemic is generalized?
* can we increase the performance of current strategies to distribute HIV prevention?
