The COVID-19 pandemic needs no introduction. At its early stage (early 2020) I focused on estimating the risk of importing cases from areas where circulation was already ongoing. Then, I studied how to use human mobility data to explain country-level circulation, to assess the impact and performance of public health interventions (e.g., movement restrictions), across socioeconomic strata, highlighting their inequity.
